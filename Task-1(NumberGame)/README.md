# NumberguessingGame
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game repository! This Java program allows users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. Additionally, you can limit the number of attempts, enable multiple rounds, and display the user's score.
